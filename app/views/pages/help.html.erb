    <h4>Shuffling Methods</h4>
    <p>There are <%= Game::SHUFFLE_METHODS.size %> methods to choose from when creating a new game:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>Completely random:</u> There are no constraints. <br>This is similar to the base game's method of setting up loyalties.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>Devout must be unique:</u> Guarantees that the "Devout" (1st) loyalty is different for each player. <br>This is similar to the variant proposed by the designer <%= link_to 'here', 'https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2331013/variants' %>.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>Devout and Opposed must be unique:</u> Guarantees that both the "Devout" (1st) and "Opposed" (5th) loyalties are different for each player.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>All factions have at least 2 unique loyalties:</u> Each pair of factions will have at least 2 loyalties that are in different positions.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>All factions have at least 3 unique loyalties:</u> Each pair of factions will have at least 3 loyalties that are in different positions.

      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>All factions have at least 4 unique loyalties:</u> Each pair of factions will have at least 4 loyalties that are in different positions.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>Cyclical - 3 or 4 players only:</u> Each faction's "Devout" loyalty will be the "Opposed" loyalty of another player, forming a circular relationship between all players. Whether you are using 3 or 4 players will determine which other loyalties will be cyclical. Some loyalties will be identical for all player.
      </li>
      <li class="help-list-item">
        <u>Teams - 4 players only:</u> The players will form 2 teams, where each team has the same 2 empires in it's "Devout" and "Dutiful" loyalties, and the same 2 empires in it's "Unallied" and "Opposed" loyalties. The team members will have different loyalties within this setup. The "Affiliated" (3rd) loyalty will be identical for all player.
